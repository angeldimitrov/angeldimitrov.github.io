### The Problem with Vibe Coding
There's a big difference between casual "vibe coding" experiments and what I offer.

Vibe coding is what happens when non-professionals play with AI tools to quickly spin up prototypes, test ideas, or generate snippets of code. It's fun, it's creative, and it's great for learning or hacking together small projects. But it's not built for scale, reliability, or production use.

### Enterprise AI Workflows
AI Agent Workflows, on the other hand, are enterprise-grade systems where AI is integrated across the full development lifecycle — from planning and architecture, through implementation, testing, deployment, and monitoring. Multiple specialized agents collaborate in parallel, working under professional standards with quality checks, CI/CD pipelines, and security considerations. This isn't about "seeing what works" — it's about delivering reliable, maintainable, production-ready software at scale.

### Professional Consulting Approach
What I provide is not coding lessons or playground experiments. I bring structured, enterprise-level consulting: helping organizations adopt AI-native development lifecycles that cut delivery times, reduce costs, and raise quality while maintaining compliance, governance, and long-term maintainability.

### Bottom Line
In short: I don't teach vibe coding. I help you build the future of enterprise software development with AI.
