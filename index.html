          I'm Angel Dimitrov — CTO, founder, and consultant with 15+ years of
          experience leading engineering teams and delivering software products.
          I co-founded startups and ran my own agency, delivering projects
          end-to-end. I've held leadership roles at Home24, Zalando, Flaconi,
          Republik.gg, Rocket Internet, Schwarz Gruppe, and WR Wertstoffbörse.
          This journey gave me experience across startups, scaleups, and
          enterprises. My expertise spans software architecture, cloud,
          AI-driven development, and building high-performance teams. Today, I
          focus on helping companies adopt AI-native development workflows —
          cutting delivery times, reducing costs, and improving quality, while
          preparing teams for the future of software development.
